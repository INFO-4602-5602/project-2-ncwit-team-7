This project is built with Bokek, and can be run by using the html file to open a web page or run python3 vis_start.py to build the visualization.

<h2>How to Run</h2>

</ol>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>
<h3>Time Visualization - Guillermo</h3>
In this visualization, we examined the total number of inital enrollments and total graduating female students within all institutions that provided this information. In our script, we discarded any results that did not provide this data when charting our data.
